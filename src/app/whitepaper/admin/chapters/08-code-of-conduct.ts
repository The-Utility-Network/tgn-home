Nobody gets excited about rules. Let's be honest—reading a code of conduct isn't anyone's idea of a good time.

But here's the thing: the alternative is worse. Without shared expectations, communities become chaotic free-for-alls where the loudest, nastiest voices dominate. Rules create the foundation for everything good that happens here.

Think of the code of conduct as a social contract. By participating in The Utility Company Discord, you're implicitly agreeing to certain norms. In exchange, you get a community that maintains certain standards—a space that's actually worth spending time in.

The rules don't exist to limit you. They exist to create the conditions for positive interaction. Every constraint is in service of freedom—the freedom to participate without harassment, to share without mockery, to engage without bad-faith attacks.

This chapter explains what we expect and why. Understanding the *purpose* makes following the *rules* feel less like compliance and more like community building.

Let's start with the principles before getting to specifics.

**Treat everyone with respect.** This isn't complicated. You don't have to like everyone. You don't have to agree with everyone. But you do have to treat them as humans deserving basic dignity. No exceptions for people you disagree with. No exceptions for people who annoy you.

**Act in good faith.** When you engage with others, do so honestly. Mean what you say. Don't twist words, set traps, or argue in bad faith. If you're angry, say you're angry—don't pretend to be calm while being passive-aggressive.

**Contribute more than you take.** Great communities are built by people who show up to add value, not extract it. Ask yourself: are you making this place better by being here?

**Accept that administrators have authority.** You don't have to agree with every decision. You can appeal, critique, and advocate for change. But when decisions are made, they're made. Ongoing defiance of administrative decisions becomes its own problem.

These principles cover most situations. The specific rules that follow are applications of these principles to common scenarios.

            heading: `Speaking to Each Other Like Humans`,
            content: `
Language matters. Not just what you say, but how you say it.

Here's the standard: communicate in ways you'd be comfortable having attributed to you publicly. If you wouldn't want a screenshot of your message shown to your employer, your family, or your future self—reconsider sending it.

**Tone is real.** The same words can be friendly or hostile depending on how they're delivered. Type like you're talking to someone you respect, even when you disagree with them.

**Cultural sensitivity matters.** This is an international community. What's normal banter in one culture might be offensive in another. When in doubt, err toward formality rather than casualness.

**Sarcasm is risky.** Genuinely hard to convey in text. If you must be sarcastic, make it extremely obvious. Ambiguous sarcasm often lands as sincere hostility.

**Offensive language is out.** Slurs, hate speech, and language that demeans identity groups are strictly prohibited. This isn't about being "politically correct"—it's about not making community spaces hostile for entire categories of people.

**Personal attacks are different from substantive criticism.** You can criticize ideas vigorously. You cannot attack the person holding those ideas. "Your argument has flaws" is fine. "You're an idiot" is not.

When in doubt, take a breath before hitting send. A few seconds of reflection prevents a lot of drama.

Some behaviors result in immediate action. No warnings, no second chances:

**Harassment** — Targeting individuals with unwanted attention, threats, or sustained negative behavior. One bad message might be a mistake; patterns are choices.

**Hate speech** — Attacks on people based on identity characteristics: race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexuality, disability, etc. Absolutely zero tolerance.

**Illegal content** — Don't share content that's illegal. This should be obvious but apparently needs stating.

**Doxing** — Exposing personal information about others without consent. A serious violation of privacy and safety.

**Scamming or phishing** — Attempting to defraud community members or capture their credentials.

**Spamming** — High-volume low-value messages, repetitive self-promotion, or flooding channels with garbage.

Other behaviors are problematic but might get warnings before escalation:

**Persistent off-topic posting** — Channels exist for reasons. Staying on topic is a courtesy.

**Excessive self-promotion** — Communities tolerate some promotion from active contributors. Pure marketers aren't welcome.

**Disruptive arguing** — Some debate is healthy. Extended, bad-faith argument that dominates spaces isn't.

**Minimodding** — Leave enforcement to enforcers. Helpful reminders about rules are fine; attempting to adjudicate disputes isn't.

The distinguishing factor is usually intent and pattern. One-off mistakes earn patience. Clear patterns or obvious bad intent earn faster responses.

            content: `
Consequences exist on a spectrum. What happens to you depends on what you did, your history, and whether you seem to have learned anything.

**Verbal warnings** — For minor first offenses. Someone explains what you did wrong and why. Take the feedback.

**Written warnings** — Documented formally. Creates a record. Multiple written warnings suggest a pattern.

**Temporary mutes** — You lose the ability to post for a defined period. Think of it as mandatory reflection time.

**Channel restrictions** — Access to specific channels removed. Maybe you can't participate in a particular area where you've caused problems.

**Temporary bans** — Full removal from the community for a set period. Serious signal that behavior is unacceptable.

**Permanent bans** — You're done here. Reserved for severe violations or patterns that demonstrate someone can't or won't participate constructively.

Consequences aren't about punishment for its own sake. They're about protecting the community and, when possible, helping the person course-correct. Most people who receive warnings don't repeat the behavior. We'd rather rehabilitate than exile.

But some people can't or won't adapt. For them, removal becomes necessary. The community's health takes priority.

            heading: `Reporting and Response`,
            content: `
See something that violates the code of conduct? Report it.

**How to report** — Direct message to any moderator or administrator. Use the ticketing system if available. Include context: what happened, where, and any relevant links or screenshots.

**What happens after you report** — Your report gets reviewed by appropriate staff. They investigate—gathering context, sometimes reaching out to involved parties. A decision is made about response.

**Confidentiality** — Reporters are not disclosed to the reported party without consent. We want people to feel safe reporting without fear of retaliation.

**Timeliness** — We aim to acknowledge reports quickly, even when full investigation takes longer. You won't be left wondering whether anyone saw your report.

**Feedback** — When appropriate, we'll let reporters know the outcome. Confidentiality limits details, but we'll confirm that action was taken.

**Good-faith reporting expected** — Report what you genuinely believe violates rules. Weaponizing the report system for personal disputes is itself a violation.

The reporting system works because people use it. Don't assume someone else will report. Don't assume staff already knows. Your report might be the one that triggers action.
