The founding of the Bootleggers Guild reads like the setup to a noir joke. A disgraced sheriff. A fallen intelligence agent. And enough bad decisions between them to stock a confession booth for years.

**Sheriff BeardedBro** was once the law in these parts—respected, feared, trusted with keeping order. Then came accusations. Corruption. Abuse of power. The trial was messy and public. The conviction was swift.

**Agent Brew** had a different fall. Central Intelligence Utility doesn't discuss why their agents get burned. What's known is that Brew had clearance one day and a Gulag sentence the next. Some secrets stay secrets.

Two fallen power-holders, stripped of everything that defined them, thrown into the same prison. What do you do with all that frustrated ambition?

You build a bootlegging operation, obviously.

BeardedBro brought enforcement knowledge—understanding how contraband moves, where the weak points are, how not to get caught. Brew brought intelligence tradecraft—networks, drops, operational security.

Together, they built the Bootleggers Guild from the East Wing up. Moonshine flowing within months. A black market economy within the year.

From fall to founding. It's a pattern in The Gulag.

The Bootleggers Guild has attracted more than its share of colorful characters. When your guild is literally about producing illegal alcohol, even by prison standards, you don't attract the timid.

The founding duo set the tone—but the guild grew through recruitment of specialists. Distillers with actual chemistry knowledge. Smugglers with logistics experience. Salespeople who could move product without attracting administrative attention.

The guild developed a reputation: work hard, party harder, trust no one outside the family. That last bit matters. When you're moving contraband, loose lips don't just sink ships—they get people sentenced to solitary.

Internal culture emphasizes loyalty and competence in equal measure. Do your job well. Keep guild business in the guild. Stand by your brothers and sisters when they need you.

The result is a tight-knit organization that outsiders find hard to penetrate. Which is exactly the point.

Let's talk about the core business: making booze that shouldn't exist.

Somewhere in the depths of the East Wing, hidden from casual observation, the Bootleggers operate a distillery. It's not fancy—prison equipment never is—but it's effective. Corn mash goes in. Moonshine comes out. Chemistry isn't complicated when you know what you're doing.

But the distillery is just the beginning.

**Sourcing**: Raw materials don't appear magically. The guild maintains supply chains for grain, yeast, sugar—whatever the recipes require. Some of this comes through official Commissary trades. Some... doesn't.

**Processing**: Quality control matters. Badly made moonshine can blind you or worse. The Bootleggers take pride in product quality. Their reputation depends on it.

**Distribution**: Getting product to customers without attracting attention. Dead drops. Trusted intermediaries. Coded communications. The intelligence tradecraft from Brew's past life finds practical application.

**Procurement**: Not all liquor is made in-house. The guild also sources from outside connections—whiskey, vodka, specialty items for discerning palates. When you want something specific and are willing to pay, the Bootleggers can usually deliver.

In The Gulag economy, liquor plays multiple roles. Recreation, obviously. But also currency—a reliable store of value that everyone wants. And social lubricant, literally, for negotiations and celebrations.

The Bootleggers supply it all.

The Bootleggers Guild doesn't just sell liquor—they're at the heart of The Gulag's shadow economy.

Every prison has one. Official commissary for official goods, and unofficial channels for everything else. The Bootleggers built their empire on understanding this fundamental truth.

**Contraband Networks**: Liquor is just the flagship product. The same channels that move moonshine can move other things. Luxury goods. Information. Favors.

**Connections**: The guild maintains relationships with members of the outside world—people who can bring things in that aren't available through legitimate channels.

**Service Economy**: Sometimes what people need isn't a product but a service. An introduction to the right person. Help navigating administrative processes. The kind of assistance that isn't offered officially but is extremely valuable.

The Administration knows this shadow economy exists. They tolerate it within limits because the alternative—total prohibition—would be unenforceable and destabilizing. Better to have channels they understand than drive everything so far underground it's invisible.

It's an uneasy balance. The Bootleggers walk the line between profitable operation and going too far. So far, they've been good at it.

            heading: `The Bootleggers' Code`,
            content: `
Rules among rule-breakers? Absolutely.

The Bootleggers Guild operates under a code of conduct that members take seriously. Not because the Administration requires it, but because the guild's survival depends on it.

**No Stealing From Members**: Obvious, but foundational. Guild brothers and sisters are off-limits. Period.

**No Violence Without Authorization**: Muscle has its place, but freelance enforcement causes problems. Disputes go through guild leadership.

**No Snitching**: This one's life-or-death. Information about guild operations stays in the guild. Violators face consequences worse than anything the Administration would do.

**No Outside Exploitation**: Selling to non-guild members is fine. Exploiting them through force or fraud is not. Bad reputation spreads and hurts everyone.

**Commissary Conduct**: Trade in the Commissary follows established norms. Fair dealing, honest measuring, prompt delivery.

Violations bring consequences escalating from warnings to loss of guild privileges to, in extreme cases, expulsion. Given how much protection guild membership provides, expulsion is essentially a death sentence for life in The Gulag.

It's a code built on pragmatism. The behaviors prohibited aren't banned because they're morally wrong, but because they threaten the guild's cohesion and reputation. The logic is cold but effective.

            content: `
Here's the twist: the Bootleggers Guild is one of the most democratic organizations in The Gulag.

Leadership isn't seized through force or inherited through connections. It's elected.

The guild operates through a council of seven members, each representing a different area of guild operations. Council seats are elected every three months. Every full member gets one vote.

Want to serve on the council? You need at least one month of guild membership and good standing with the Administration. Announce your candidacy. Campaign. Let the members decide.

The council makes major decisions: profit distribution, resource allocation, strategic direction, disciplinary matters. Individual council members handle their areas of responsibility, but major choices require consensus.

Why democracy? Partly pragmatism—giving members voice increases buy-in and reduces internal conflict. Partly values—BeardedBro's law enforcement background and Brew's intelligence experience both included deep familiarity with how authoritarian structures fail.

The result is an organization that's both criminal enterprise and participatory community. Contraband and consent. Moonshine and voting rights.

Only in The Gulag.

The Bootleggers Guild has plans, and they're not small ones.

**Product Expansion**: New types of liquor. Specialty items for high-value customers. Maybe even aging programs for premium goods (if they can find the storage).

**Channel Development**: More reliable supply chains. Better distribution networks. Reducing risk while expanding reach.

**Partnerships**: Deeper relationships with other guilds. The Copper Cutters collaboration works well—similar arrangements with the Pot Growers could create new opportunities.

**Talent Acquisition**: Actively recruiting members with specialized skills. Chemistry knowledge. Logistics experience. Intelligence backgrounds. The guild needs more than labor—it needs expertise.

**External Expansion**: The long-term dream is operations beyond The Gulag itself. If The Utility Company's I3AS vision pans out, there might be legitimate (or at least less illegitimate) opportunities for the skills the Bootleggers have developed.

The guild that BeardedBro and Brew founded from disgrace has become a pillar of The Gulag economy. Its future—like the futures of all The Gulag's factions—depends on continued adaptation, smart leadership, and the right amount of luck.

The moonshine keeps flowing. The story keeps developing.

Pour one out for the journey still ahead.
