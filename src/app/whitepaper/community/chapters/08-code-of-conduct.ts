Look, we get it. A code of conduct in a prison community feels a bit ironic. Everyone here already broke rules at least once—that's why they're here.

But here's the thing: rules aren't about control for control's sake. They're about creating predictability.

When everyone knows what's expected, they can plan. They can trust (within reasonable limits). They can focus on their work instead of constantly watching their backs.

The Gulag Code of Conduct exists to establish that predictability. Not because anyone thinks convicts are going to spontaneously become rule-followers, but because clear expectations create space for real community to form.

The code promotes stability. The Grande Narrative provides meaning. Together, they create conditions where redemption arcs can actually happen.

Without this foundation? Just chaos. The strong preying on the weak. Zero-sum competition destroying any chance of collective progress.

So yes, rules. Because the alternative is worse.

            content: `
Let's start with the obvious stuff. The rules that exist because somehow someone made them necessary:

**Respect Other Members**: Radical concept, we know. Regardless of guild affiliation, criminal history, or personal beef—treat people like they're people. No slurs. No attacks on identity. No making The Yard a hostile environment.

**No Spam**: The channels aren't your personal billboard. Keep content relevant. Keep quantity reasonable. Nobody wants to scroll through fifty emoji reactions to find actual conversations.

**No Scamming**: This is literally a community of criminals and *we're* saying don't scam each other. The ecosystem depends on basic trust. Undermine that, and everyone suffers.

**No Illegal Activities**: Even by Gulag standards. Some things are out of bounds everywhere. Hacking. Piracy. Anything that would bring real-world legal consequences down on the community.

**Follow Guild Rules**: Each guild has additional rules specific to their operations. If you're a Pot Grower, follow Pot Grower rules. If you're a Copper Cutter, follow Copper Cutter rules. Your guild, your additional obligations.

This isn't complicated. Don't be terrible. Let other people do their thing. Basic prison etiquette, really.

            heading: `Communication: How to Disagree Without Drama`,
            content: `
Conflicts happen. In any community. In a community of convicted criminals? Count on it.

The code doesn't pretend everyone will get along. Instead, it provides frameworks for productive disagreement.

**Respect First**: Even when you're furious. Even when the other person is clearly wrong. The moment you switch from arguing a point to attacking a person, you've lost the argument anyway.

**Actually Listen**: Before responding, make sure you understand what's being said. Half of all Discord drama comes from people arguing past each other because nobody takes time to comprehend before they clap back.

**Open Mind**: Maybe you're wrong. Maybe they're wrong. Maybe you're both wrong. Consider the possibility that your position isn't the only valid one.

**Constructive Feedback**: If you're criticizing, offer something useful. "This sucks" isn't feedback—it's venting. "This sucks because X, maybe try Y" is actually helpful.

The goal isn't agreement. It's productive exchange. People can disagree and still work together if they disagree respectfully.

Flame wars, on the other hand, help nobody and waste everyone's time.

            heading: `The Things You Cannot Do`,
            content: `
Some behaviors cross lines that communities can't tolerate. These are the bright-line prohibitions:

**Harassment and Bullying**: This gets you removed, period. Targeted campaigns against other members. Racist, sexist, homophobic attacks. Making people feel unsafe. Zero tolerance.

**Hate Speech**: Advocacy for violence against protected groups. Dehumanizing rhetoric. The kind of content that makes communities toxic and attracts the worst elements. Not here.

**Sharing Illegal Content**: Pirated software. Copyrighted material distributed without rights. Anything that creates legal liability for the community.

**Doxxing**: Sharing personal information about members without consent. Real names. Addresses. Phone numbers. Anything that could enable real-world harm.

**Severe Spam**: Not just annoying, but disruptive. The kind that breaks channels and makes them unusable.

These aren't negotiable. They don't get warnings. The behaviors themselves are so damaging that allowing them at all destroys the trust the community depends on.

Cross these lines, and you're not getting a talking-to. You're getting sentenced.

            heading: `When Rules Get Broken: Reporting and Enforcement`,
            content: `
Rules mean nothing without enforcement. Here's how that works.

**Reporting**: If you see a violation, report it. Whether to guild leadership (for internal matters) or the Gulag Administration (for broader issues). Don't handle it yourself unless you're authorized to.

**Investigation**: Reports get investigated. Not every report is valid; some are misunderstandings, some are personal vendettas dressed up as rule-breaking. The Administration figures out what actually happened.

**Proportional Response**: Minor violations get minor consequences—warnings, maybe temporary loss of privileges. Major violations get major consequences—suspension, removal, or worse.

**Appeals**: Think you got a raw deal? There's an appeals process. Make your case. The Administration reviews. Final decision gets made.

The system isn't perfect. No system is. But it tries to be fair, transparent, and consistent. Same rules for everyone. Same processes for everyone.

If you're going to have authority, it needs checks. The enforcement framework provides those checks.

            heading: `Consequences: What Happens When You Screw Up`,
            content: `
Violate the code, face consequences. What consequences? Depends on what you did.

**Warnings**: First offense for minor stuff. Official acknowledgment that you messed up. Goes on your record.

**Privilege Suspension**: Lose access to certain channels, features, or activities. Temporary—demonstrate better behavior and you get them back.

**Guild Discipline**: For inter-guild matters, your guild handles it. They know you. They know the context. Let them sort it out.

**Community Removal**: For serious violations, you're out. Not the Gulag—you were already in the Gulag. This is solitary. Exile. Gone.

**Escalation**: Repeated minor violations escalate. First warning, second warning, then actual consequences. Pattern matters.

The severity matches the offense. Accidentally spam once? Warning. Systematically harass someone? Gone. The punishment fits the crime.

And just like in the outside world—ignorance isn't an excuse. The rules are published. Read them.

            heading: `Changing the Rules: Amendments and Evolution`,
            content: `
The Code of Conduct isn't scripture. It's a living document.

Communities change. New situations arise. What made sense in year one might not make sense in year three. The code needs to adapt.

**Amendment Process**: Changes can be proposed. They get discussed. If there's consensus that an update is needed, it happens. The Administration has final say, but community input matters.

**Communication**: When rules change, everyone gets notified. No stealth edits. No gotcha enforcement of rules people didn't know about.

**Documentation**: The current version is always available. Historical versions are archived. You can see how the code evolved over time.

**Feedback**: If you think a rule is unjust or ineffective, say so. Through proper channels. The Administration listens (though they don't always agree).

A code that can't change becomes a code that doesn't work. New situations demand new responses. The framework allows for that while maintaining stability.

Change is orderly. Change is transparent. Change serves the community.

That's how governance should work, even—especially—in prison.
